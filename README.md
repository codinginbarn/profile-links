# LinkFree Generator

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This is a simple graphical interface to generate your own [LinkFree](https://github.com/MichaelBarney/LinkFree). You can select from many user contributed themes. The themes are contained in [chriskthomas/linkfree-themes](https://github.com/chriskthomas/linkfree-themes). Please feel free to contribute your own themes!

The generator produces a single `index.html` file which can easily be uploaded to any hosting service.
